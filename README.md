# Copy for LLM Plus JetBrains Plugin

Copies selected project file structure and content to the clipboard, formatted for pasting into Large Language Models (
LLMs).

# Usage

Right-click files/folders in the Project view, select "Copy for LLM", and paste into your LLM prompt.

The output includes a file tree representing the selection within the project and the content of the included files,
each preceded by a header comment indicating its path relative to the project root.

# Caveats

Only tested with IntelliJ. Other JetBrains IDEs should work, but are not guaranteed to be supported.
